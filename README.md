Welcome to my project repository. My name is Jason and I'm a Business Analytics graduate from Imperial College London. I use this repository to highlight the projects I've completed during the course of my master's programme.

## List of Projects

1. **Topic modelling of user web activities**
   * **Data source:** IPSOS
   * **Description:** By performing topic modelling on customers' web browsing activities, we can understand their preferences and interests. We explore various algorithm to retreive the relevant topics, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF)

2. **Marketing mix modelling on promotion effectiveness**
   * **Data source:** Dunnhumby
   * **Description:** In-store promotions are the go-to marketing strategies for retail stores, but how effective are they in boosting sales. We use the SCAN\*PRO model to measure the elasticities of various promotional and pricing strategies, as well as any temporal or cannibalisation effects
3. **Daily energy demand forecasting**
   * **Data source:** ICBS
   * **Description:** Balancing the energy demand and load generation is key to running cost-efficient grid operations. In order to do so, having an accurate forecast of the next day's load demand is needed. Here, we perform time series analysis and various forecasting methods in order to generate 2-day forecasts with high precision and robustness.
4. **World cup data exploration**
   * **Data source:** martj42 github repo
   * **Description:** With the coming World Cup '22 in Qatar, it piqued my interest to explore more into the football scenes. We use Spark SQL here to display the potential integration of SQL with pandas in python.
5. **Heat Smart Orkney demand-response evaluation**
   * **Data source:** ICBS/Kaluza
   * **Description:** Orkney Islands is one of the largest wind energy hubs in the UK, however it faces an issue of high curtailment. Curtailment has high opportunity cost since wind energy cannot be harvested on demand. Here, we assess the degree of curtailment and perform scenario analysis to recommend a business plan to curb the issue.
