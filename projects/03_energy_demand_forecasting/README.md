# 03. UK Daily Energy Demand Forecasting

### Data Source

Data was provided by Imperial College, but was based on real-life dataset.

### Objectives

In the energy market, being able to accurately predict the next day's energy demand is highly important to plan for a cost-efficient grid operation. 
This project was an assigment and also a competition to build a forecasting model that can accurately predict the next 2-day load demand.

### Methodology

The final model was build on 3 iterations, based on several trial-and-errors.
