### Objectives

Part of my retail marketing assignment to apply marketing mix modelling (MMM) techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies.
In this case, we will look into how in-store promotions, such as circulars and display promotion, as well as temporary price cuts affect sales.

### Methodology

To assess the effectiveness of the various marketing strategies of the particular retail store, we use the SCAN*PRO model, which is one of the most well-known models to estimate the impact of promotions.
We will focus on measuring the elasticities of display promotion, feature advertising and temporary price reductions on sales of mouthwash products from a store in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
As an extension to the classical SCAN*PRO model, we introduce leading and lagging prices to measure temporal effects.
